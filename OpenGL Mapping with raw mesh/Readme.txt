This is a machine problem of one of my courses. Demo is implemented with fragment shader and vertex shader. It demenstrates openGL texture mapping and environment mapping.

This is built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. To try out, please put all relevent files into your test project.

You could also download the whole folder and simply run teapotDemo.exe.

This teapot is NOT using the pre-implemented teapot in OpenGL. It is using raw mesh information w/o normals.

Demo video of this project could be found at http://youtu.be/0xxyAoYH-lc
