Hello! This is my other OpenGL Demo for one of my upper division graphic class.

Please see the demo at http://youtu.be/Sh8LEgaUFcw. (Shame for me to use the same images as my previous OpenGL demo.. I really love the forth one though :))

It implements Catmull-Clark Subdivision Algorithm, Cubic Bezier Curve and Texture/Environment Mapping and Lighting. The subdivision output quads, I translated them to traingles to fit my mapping algorithms. Saves a lot of troubles~

Press the following button to get it working (Those functions have all been shown in the demo video): 
¡°d¡± to do subdivision. You can do as many time as you need, I didn¡¯t limit it to 2 times (3 versions). 

"z" to stop moving, you can press "z" again to start the Bezier curve movement. (Don't know why I chose z.. guess it's because it's at the bottom left corner...)

"f" to switch between rendering mode: texture mapping | environment mapping | environment and texture mix
"e" to change an environment picture
"t" to change texture picture
"s" to switch between skeleton and the rendered teapot
"up, down" to let you eye go up and down (when stopped)
"left, right" to zoom in and out (when stopped)

Happy playing with my I demonstration!
